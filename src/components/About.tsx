          , a passionate web developer with a strong focus on building
          responsive, user-friendly web and mobile applications. My journey in
          tech started with curiosity and grew into a full-blown passion for
          software development.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I recently graduated and completed my OJT at the City Hall of Tagum,
          where I helped develop systems using technologies like Vue.js, Quasar,
          Laravel, React, and Flutter. I enjoy solving real-world problems with
          code and continuously learning new technologies to sharpen my skills.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          When I'm not coding, Iâ€™m usually exploring new tools, tinkering with
          design ideas, or studying software architecture to grow as a developer.
